## Overview

  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rating), binwidth = 0.25)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(0)
```

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(x = as_datetime(timestamp), y = rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = 'timestamp', y = 'rating')
```


```{r}

```

`r as_datetime(half_stars_startpoint)`

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#' This object-constructor function is used to generate a metamodel

#' The predictions are performed by choosing the appropriate model according to the 
#' data's timestamp.
#' 
#' @param dataset The dataset used to fit both models,
#'    it should contain a column called 'timestamp'
#' @param base_model_generator The function used to generate the base models,

## Methods

### Simple Average

```{r}
#' This object-constructor function is used to generate a model
#' that always returns as prediction the average of the rating in the
#' given dataset used to fit the model.
#' @param dataset The dataset used to fit the model
#' @return The model
SimpleAvgModel <- function(dataset) {
  model <- list()

  # The average of ratings
  model$mu <- mean(dataset$rating)

  #' The prediction function
  #' @param s The dataset used to perform the prediction of
  #' @return A vector containing the prediction
  model$predict <- function(s) {
    model$mu
  }

  model
}
```


```{r}
pred <- SimpleAvgModel(edx)$predict(edx)
```

```{r}
RMSE(pred, edx$rating)
```

```{r}
mean(pred2stars(edx$timestamp, pred) == edx$rating)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
