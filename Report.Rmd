```

## Overview

```{r poc01}
edx %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = rating), binwidth = 0.25)
```


```{r poc02}
set.seed(0)
edx[createDataPartition(y = edx$rating, times = 1, p = 0.001, list = FALSE),] %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as_datetime(timestamp), y = rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = as_datetime(half_stars_begining)),
             color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(aes(x = as_datetime(half_stars_begining),
                label = as_datetime(half_stars_begining),
                y = 2.5),
            color = "red", vjust = -1, angle = 90)
```

## Methods

### Pseudo Linear Model

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
